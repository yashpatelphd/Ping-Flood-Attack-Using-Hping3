# Ping Flood Attack Using Hping3
An educational repository demonstrating a SYN flood DoS attack using Metasploit on a controlled network environment. This project provides step-by-step instructions to illustrate network vulnerabilities and strengthen cybersecurity awareness.

# Requirements
1. Victim Machine: A machine running Ubuntu Linux, configured as the target system for the attack.
2. Attacker Machine: A machine running Kali Linux, equipped with tools necessary for launching the attack.
3. Tools: Hping3 for attack deployment, nmap for port scanning, and Wireshark for traffic analysis.


# Step 1:  Identify the IP Addresses of the Victim and Attacker Machines
To successfully execute the attack, the IP addresses of both the attacker and victim machines must be noted.

# On the Victim Machine (Ubuntu)

1. Open the terminal on the Ubuntu machine.
2. Enter the command:

   ***ifconfig***

3. Locate and write down the machine’s IP address, which typically appears under inet in the output (e.g., 192.168.x.x).

# On the Attacker Machine (Kali Linux)

1. Open the terminal on the Kali machine.
2. Enter the command:
  
   ***ifconfig***

3. Write down the IP address of the attacker machine for later use.

# Step 2: Scan the Victim Machine for Open Ports
Verifying open ports on the victim machine is important to determine which ports are accessible. Often, certain ports (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS) are targeted in ping flood attacks.

1. On the Attacker Machine in the terminal, type:

   ***nmap [Victim’s IP Address]***

2. Review the output to confirm that necessary ports (such as 80 for HTTP) are open on the victim machine.

# Step 3: Configure the Ping Flood Attack Using Hping3
The Hping3 tool is a versatile command-line utility used for network testing and attack simulation. For this demonstration, it will be configured to flood the victim machine with ICMP (ping) requests.

1. In the terminal on the Attacker Machine, prepare the Hping3 command to simulate the flood.
2. The syntax for launching a SYN flood attack on a specific port (e.g., 80) with a high packet size is as follows:
  
   ***hping3 -d 65538 -S -p 80 --flood [Victim's IP Address]***

   **-d 65538**: Specifies the packet size.
   
   **-S**: Sets the SYN flag in each packet.
   
   **-p 80**: Targets port 80 (HTTP port).

   **--flood**: Sends packets at maximum speed.

4. Replace **[Victim’s IP Address]** with the actual IP of the victim machine.

# Step 4: Execute the Ping Flood Attack
Once configured, execute the attack by entering the command above. This will begin sending a high volume of ping requests to the victim’s IP on the specified port.

# Step 5: Monitor System and Network Impact
Observe the attack’s effects by monitoring resource usage on the victim machine and analyzing network traffic on the attacker machine.

On the Victim Machine

1. Open the System Monitor tool in Ubuntu to observe resource utilization:
  
   ***gnome-system-monitor***

2. Look for significant increases in CPU and network usage as the machine processes the influx of ICMP packets.

On the Attacker Machine

1. Open Wireshark to capture and analyze the network traffic generated by the flood:
  
   ***wireshark***

2. Set filters to isolate ICMP packets or view traffic between the attacker and victim machines. Notice the pattern of repeated ping requests, indicating the flood’s effect on the target.

# Conclusion and Clean-Up
The Ping flood attack demonstration is complete. Ensure that you:
- Terminate the attack by stopping the Hping3 command.
- Analyze and document any observed results.
- Restore normal operation on both machines by restarting network services if needed.

This exercise has shown how a Ping flood attack can disrupt system resources, providing valuable insights into network defense and traffic analysis for mitigation strategies.

Remember: Always respect ethical boundaries and use this knowledge to improve cyber security, not to harm or disrupt others.
